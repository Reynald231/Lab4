    <h1>Students Excel in Video Game Development</h1>
    <h2>Video Game Development</h2>

    How are you engaging students in STEM subjects in your school setting? What opportunities are available for students to develop real-world skills in these areas? Are these opportunities empowering them to choose a career in STEM? These are the aims of the Australian STEM Video Game Challenge (STEM VGC), a free national video game development competition for students in years 3-12. <br>
    The winners for the 2025 challenge have been announced today. Students are invited to work individually or in teams of up to 4 people to design and develop a video game based on a given theme. Participants are supported by a team mentor (typically a teacher) to submit their game for judging by a panel of teachers and industry experts. <br>
    We know schools around the country are integrating the STEM VGC into the curriculum, for example, in Technology and Enterprise (Wynne, 2019). To support teachers in primary and secondary settings wanting to give students the opportunity to participate in the Australian STEM VGC, free curriculum-aligned resources – including a 10-week lesson plan with tips to help teachers looking to learn alongside their students – were released for this year’s challenge (Broadley, 2025). <br>
    The skills developed reflect those identified in the Power of Play report, that surveyed 13,000 gamers in 12 countries, including Australia. Findings included 69% believed video games build problem-solving, cognitive, teamwork and collaboration skills, 65% felt they promote adaptability, and 60% felt they advance communications skills (ACER, 2023). <br>
    <br>
    <b>The 2025 Australian STEM VGC theme and winners</b> <br>
    <br>
    The 2025 challenge theme was ‘journey’. In total, 354 games were submitted across 5 categories for judging. The entries came from all states and territories. The most popular year level was year 5 (295 students) and the most popular category for entries was year 3-6 using the Scratch platform. <br>
    The winning entries will have their games showcased at the Penny Arcade Expo (PAX) held in Melbourne next month. Here’s the full list for 2025! <br>
